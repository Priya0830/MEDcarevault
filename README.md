🏥 Digital Health Record Management System for Migrant Workers (Kerala) 

📌 Project Overview 

This project is an **offline-first healthcare record management system** designed to support medical care for **migrant worker populations**, especially in low-connectivity environments. The system enables healthcare workers to securely store, retrieve, and analyze patient health records using a lightweight desktop application.

Built entirely using **Python**, the application focuses on **accessibility, reliability, and real-world usability** in public health scenarios.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Migrant workers often lack consistent access to centralized digital health records, leading to:

* Fragmented medical histories
* Delays in treatment during emergencies
* Limited access to healthcare data in offline or rural settings

This project addresses these challenges by providing a **local, offline-capable health record system** with quick record retrieval and reporting features.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* **Offline-First Architecture**
  Designed to function without internet connectivity using a local SQLite database.

* **Structured Health Record Storage**
  Stores longitudinal patient health data securely and efficiently.

* **QR-Based Health ID System**
  Generates unique QR-coded Health IDs for each patient, allowing rapid access to medical history during consultations or emergencies.

* **Automated PDF Health Reports**
  Generates downloadable medical reports for documentation and continuity of care.

* **Health Trend Visualizations**
  Displays basic health trends through charts and graphs to support data-driven clinical decisions.

* **Scalable System Design**
  Conceptually designed for future integration with government health infrastructures such as **ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission)**.
